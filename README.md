Q1--> Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non negative integers, find a continuous sub-array that adds to a given number S and return the left and right index(1-based indexing) of that subarray. In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray indexes which come first on moving from left to right.
Q2--> Given an array Arr consisting of N distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.
